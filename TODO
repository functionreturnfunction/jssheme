* More special forms
  - case
  - (define _form_ _expr_)
  - lambda
   - mostly done, recursion still iffy

* More primitives
  - boolean?
  - char?
  - display
  - list
  - pair?
    - probably need to implement pairs

  - procedure?
  - sin
  - sqrt
  - string?
  - symbol?
  - vector?

* More compiled functions
  - number->string
    - basic form working
    - still needs radix
    - still needs type checking/error handling
      - 1st arg is not a number
      - 2nd arg is not a number
      - 2nd arg is not a valid radix

* Implement type checking for existing function and special form implementations
  - using the appropriate messages

* Create preparser
   - needs to merge & convert whitespace

* Learn and implement associative lists

* Learn and implement list mapping

* Interpreter needs to be further separated from the environment
  - need a reset function to clear all user defined values AND/OR
  - need to make an instantiatable class out of it

  - will need to be able to dump and load state (JSON?)
